### Two tier model

1. Previewing and syntax highlighting functionality with a split editor is available in the
   Basic open source edition. Intended for mostly previewing markdown documents and unaided
   editing. Wiki link refactoring and completions are also available in the basic edition to
   ease the task of wiki maintenance.

2. Advanced features used for creating and maintaining markdown documents: refactoring, find
   usages, validation, auto formatting and HTML page customizations are only available in the
   Enhanced licensed version. 15-day free trial licenses are available from [Markdown Navigator]
   page on my website.

----------------

### Next Release: Version 2.4.0

Bug and compatibility fixes you can find in [Version Notes].

* Navigate using links with **GitHub Line Reference** anchor refs
* **Copy Reference** then Paste to get **link with line reference**
* **Encode/Decode Base64 Images** Intention
* Paste Images with **Base64 Encoded** embedded image links
* **Embed Images** HTML generation option
* **Base64 embedded image** display in **Swing browser**
* **Convert Markdown to HTML** intention for fenced code elements

### Version 2.3.8

Bug and compatibility fixes you can find in [Version Notes].

* Add GitHub Line reference anchors in the form `L#` or `L#-L#` for line ranges. Now navigating
  to such an anchor in a project file will move the caret to the line and if second form is used
  select the lines.
* Add clicking on task item box in preview toggles open/closed task status in source (JavaFX
  browser).
* Add Apply all '...' in file intentions where these make sense.
* Add intention to convert between typographic symbols and markdown smarts/quotes extension
  text.
* Add `HTML block deep parsing` parser option to allow better handling of raw text tag parsing
  when they are not the first tag on the first line of the block.
* Add Launching external URLs inside the browser, now `navigate to declaration` opens url in
  browser, ftp or mail client depending on the link. Can also use line markers for navigation of
  these elements.
* Add GitBook compatible include tags when `GitBook compatibility mode` is enabled in `Parser`
  options.
* Add handling of optional quotes for jekyll include tags. Either single `'` or double `"`
  quotes will be ignored if the file name is wrapped in them.
* Add Insert table column on right actions and changed description of previous action to insert
  table column on left.
* Add #411, Network drives links are not resolved correctly, URI links outside of project now
  error highlighted if the file does not exist
* Add #433, Support external links for the Link Map (eg. JIRA link), Reference to Link Map to
  allow creating automatic reference URLs from Reference IDs
* Fix HTML generation with line source line highlighting when inline styling spans source lines
* Fix #459, PDF export does not resolve local ref anchors
* Fix #456, Register r markdown code chunk prefix
* Fix #453, Option to hide toolbar
* Fix breadcrumb tooltip of task items would be missing the task item marker
* Fix #447, Exported HTML has unexpected CSS and JS URLs
* Fix #445, there should no be default language injection in bare code chunks
* Fix #444, Markdown Navigator 2.3.7 breaks paste of github checkout url
* Fix #441, false positive typo annotation in header, caused by using IdentifierSplitter instead
  of TextSplitter to handle elements that can have references.
* Fix #442, Image Paste in Windows always pastes absolute file:// regardless of selection
* Fix #440, Auto links should not appear in fenced code

### Version 2.3.7

  in some circumstances.
